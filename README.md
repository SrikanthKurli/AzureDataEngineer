I am currently working on a database migration project for a real estate client. In their existing system, data versions are managed by creating separate databases in SQL server, which can result in inconsistencies and reporting errors when updates are missed. Now we are migrating to Azure to establish a unified data source.

* Responsible for collecting data from different sources using synapse linked services.
* Played crucial role in establishing dedicated pipelines to extract and load raw data into Data Lakehouse.
* Used Advance SQL scripts for transformation and flattening to prepare it for structure storage.
