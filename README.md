I am currently working on a database migration project for a real estate client. In their existing system, data versions are managed by creating separate databases in SQL server, which can result in inconsistencies and reporting errors when updates are missed. Now we are migrating to Azure to establish a unified data source.

* Created DevOps pipelines to migrate code to higher environment for SQL, ADF and Databricks repositories.
* Added data quality checks implemented in Databricks in Raw and Transform Layer
* Designed generic Data quality framework to implement data consistency checks
* Designed data model for major workstreams in the projects.
* Worked in collaboration with business stakeholders and project leads for requirement gathering and design discussion.
* Created end to end data pipelines in ADF to ingest data from csv/excel files (On Prem/ADLS)
* Created reports using Power BI Desktop and deployed to Power BI Service to share with end users via Workspaces and Apps which implemented Row Level Security and User Group management.
* Designed, developed, maintained and delivered additional new Power BI Dashboards and Reports with complex DAX query measures/columns, drill down/drill through/hyperlink options, dynamic slicing/dicing features.
* Created Pipelines in ADF using Linked Services/Datasets/Pipeline/ to Extract, Transform, and load data from different sources like Azure SQL, Blob storage, Azure SQL Data warehouse, write-back tool and backwards.
* Designed and developed the ETL process to load data from Oracle Database, Mainframe into Snowflake DWH.
* Extract Transform and Load data from Sources Systems to Azure Data Storage services using a combination of Azure Data Factory, T-SQL, and U-SQL Azure Data Lake Analytics.
* Data Ingestion to one or more Azure Services - (Azure Data Lake, Azure Storage, Azure SQL, Azure DW) and processing the data in in Azure Databricks.
* Responsible for Interpreting data, analyze results using Data Analytics and statistical techniques and provide ongoing reports.
* Creating complex stored procedures and objects by using SQL Server Advanced T-SQL.
* Responsible for ETL jobs, created alerts. Created SSIS Packages using Pivot Transformation, Execute SQL Task, Data Flow Task, etc. to import data into the data warehouse.
* Administered and modified the SSIS Package to transfer data from various locations using the FTP task. Created SSIS and used the task to import and export files.
* Developed & optimized workflows for large amounts of structured and unstructured data, including integrating data from multiple sources, data lake architecture, business intelligence pipelines using various ETL (ELT) tools and data visualization tools such as Power BI.
* Designing and implementing performant data ingestion pipelines from multiple sources using Azure Databricks
* Successfully created database diagrams and physical models for the project. Performed cost benefit analysis of different ETL packages (SSIS) to determine the optimal process.
* Extracted data from old on-premises databases (SQL Server and Oracle) into Azure SQL Data Warehouse using Azure Data Factory and SSIS.
